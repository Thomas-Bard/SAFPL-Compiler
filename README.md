# SAFPL Compiler

## SAFPL - Shitty Absurdly Fast Programming Language

SAFPL, as its name suggests, is a shitty but fast programming language. It is compiled and uses the LLVM environment. How does it works you may ask ?
I'm willing to write a documentation in the wiki section, but as for now, I'm too lazy to do so.
